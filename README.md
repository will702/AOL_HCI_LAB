# Picverse Community

This project contains a simple web-based version of Picverse and a minimal Flutter version located in `flutter_app/`.

## Web Version

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the web version are located at the repository root. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.

## Flutter Version

A very small Flutter example is provided in `flutter_app/`. It demonstrates how the project could be structured as a Flutter application.

### Getting Started

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on your system.
2. Navigate to the `flutter_app` directory:
   ```bash
   cd flutter_app
   ```
3. Run the app on an emulator or device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

The Flutter version mirrors the basic navigation of the web version with placeholder pages for Gallery, Submit, and Community.
